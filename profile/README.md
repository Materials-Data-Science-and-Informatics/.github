## Welcome!


The Institute for Materials Data Science and Informatics (IAS-9, https://fz-juelich.de/ias/ias-9/) is Part of the Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich which is itself part of the Helmholtz Association in Germany. The IAS-9 is a multidisciplinary institute that works on topics ranging from data science & machine learning, materials simulation & theory to ontology development, research data management & software development. 

Here you can find open source software, tools, data sets and information on projects that we publish under open source licenses. 

We want to make research data more sustainable, future-proof and [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/). 
To reach this goal, we develop tools such as [Metador](https://github.com/Materials-Data-Science-and-Informatics/metador) that help to structure, streamline and validate research data in various phases of its lifecycle (also check out our other pinned repositories!).

Most of our software acctually works most of the time and usually new releases are better than older versions :wink:.
And of course, you are welcome to test, apply and use our tools and software! If you use our work, please cite (see specification in respective repository) and recommend it. Feel free to get in contact and leave a star!
